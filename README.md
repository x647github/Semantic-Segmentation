# Semantic Segmentation with CamVid HRNetV2-W48

This project performed semantic image segmentation using an image segmentation model [camvid-hrnetv2-w48](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/hrnet/frameworks/tensorFlow2/variations/hrnet-camvid-hrnetv2-w48/versions/1?tfhub-redirect=true) that was trained on [CamVid](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/), which is a driving and scene understanding dataset containing images extracted from five video sequences taken during real-world driving scenarios. The dataset contains 32 classes.
